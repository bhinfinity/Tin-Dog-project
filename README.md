# Tin Dog üê∂
A simple "Tinder for Dogs" project built with Bootstrap!

## About
Tin Dog is a playful project inspired by the concept of Tinder, but for dogs! This project was created as a way to practice and improve my Bootstrap skills. There is no JavaScript or backend functionality at the moment‚Äîit's purely a front-end prototype to explore Bootstrap's features and layout design.

This project was inspired by Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course, which provided a great foundation for learning and applying web development concepts.

While Bootstrap may not be as popular today with modern CSS frameworks, I wanted to revisit and practice using it.
